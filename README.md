# py-pong

## Overview

A simple Pong game written in Python, using [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to create a game canvas. I made a few modifications to the game after the tutorial ended, including:

* adding a motherboard beep when the ball collides with a wall
* adding the Halo multiplayer announcer as a start-of-round audio queue
* adding scaling difficulty, making the ball move faster after each goal
* setting limitations to prevent the paddles from leaving the canvas
